This project is a template for getting started with SBT and Akka's REST support.  It simply provides an initial development environment for experimentation.

If you're not familiar with SBT then checkout http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup for mor information about getting started.  I've included the necessary SBT files for a unix based-machine so you can skip ahead if you are impatent.

NOTE: Make sure you don't have the AKKA_HOME environment variable set, because this project uses the AkkaServlet to run the application in a seperate container.  Use the src/main/resource/akka.conf to configure any akka settings.

Getting started:
1. cd akka-template-rest
2. ./sbt
3. update
4. jetty-run
5. http://localhost:8080/hello
